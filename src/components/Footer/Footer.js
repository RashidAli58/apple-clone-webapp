            eligible for credit. You must be at least the age of majority to be

            purchase. In‑store trade‑in requires presentation of a valid photo
            ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
            available in all stores, and may vary between in‑store and online

            trade‑in partners reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or limit
            quantity of any trade‑in transaction for any reason. More details
            are available from Apple’s trade-in partner for trade‑in and
            recycling of eligible devices. Restrictions and limitations may
            apply.
